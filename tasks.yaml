Transport system
#  After a harvester finishes harvesting, the resource is added to the storage.
#  Another system (for example, ResourceStorageSystem) sends the resource to a seller (it is now impossible to send it
#  anywhere else)
  ResourceStorageSystem
#    Finds sellers for resources
#    Creates ResourceRoutes
  A ResourceTransportSystem
#    One route per entity
#    On route start, removes resource from storage and starts updating the path
    Additionaly, it sends a message to the client that a transport is happening
    The client will render a dude with the resource travelling
    After the transfer ends, if the storage has enough space, the resource will be added to the storage
    After the transfer ends, if the storage has enough space, a message will be sent to the client to add the resource
    If the target does not have enough space, the dude will wait
