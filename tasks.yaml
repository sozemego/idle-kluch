#Transport system
#  After a harvester finishes harvesting, the resource is added to the storage.
#  Another system (for example, ResourceStorageSystem) sends the resource to a seller (it is now impossible to send it
#  anywhere else)
#  ResourceStorageSystem
#    Finds sellers for resources
#    Creates ResourceRoutes
#  A ResourceTransportSystem
#    One route per entity
#    On route start, removes resource from storage and starts updating the path
#    Additionaly, it sends a message to the client that a transport is happening
#    The client will render a dude with the resource travelling
#    After the transfer ends, if the storage has enough space, the resource will be added to the storage
#    After the transfer ends, if the storage has enough space, a message will be sent to the client to add the resource
#    If the target does not have enough space, the dude will wait
#    On front-end, when transport starts, a resource has to be removed from storage
#     Can have multiple routes per storage
